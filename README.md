# Cloud_storage

This is my first more professional flask webapp


## Setup & Installation
- Ensure you have python 3.6+ installed.

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- In ```main.py``` replace ```"your_IPv4"``` with your IPv4, which you will find when you type ```ipconfig``` on your terminal.
- Also in ```main.py``` replace ```"your_path"``` with the location where the repository is stored (You can use cloud storage in any location, but previews will not work!!!).


## Running the Server
```
python main.py
```

## Viewing The App

Go to `http://your_IPv4:1111`
